## Theme : calculations

You have to take a certain number of steps to reach the goal.

if you stop on a door, it opens the door

if you step over a + or x2 your steps increase for this move

## Resources

* Numbers based on https://www.dafont.com/bestime.font?text=0+1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9

## TODO

* ✅ reset button, in case the palyer softlocks themselves
* Tiles you're not allowed to stop on (maybe there's no dot)
* ✅ Spash screen
* track the number of turns, and have a par
* imps that move left/right or up/down each turn
* Different palettes
