idea
	turn based roguelike
	pick up coins to pay to unlock doors. you need the exact change
doors can hold money or weapons or baddies
baddies drop coins
	- how do we deal with situations where you can't progress

or maybe you can only move X steps exactly (like mario party) and you have 3 "cards" to choose from. once used you get a new random one

bad guys have Y health, so if they ave 2 health and are 4 away, you can kill them


maybe just indoors
make rectangle room, make doors that linkto nothing orexistng ghost roms, make ghhst rooms on other side of dooorskk
